- Add versioning support to detect game version
  (and use version-specific information from it)
- Redo map rendering code? It's horrible.
- Fix chest, statue, etc so they don't display when used up.
- Fix state reading so it doesn't blow up on unfreed game memory
  (ie, quitting a game and attempting to update will cause maximap to crash)
